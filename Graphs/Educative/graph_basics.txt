Types of Graphs:
----------------
1. Undirected Graphs -
    - If there are n vertices, maximum possible number of edges are = n(n-1)/2

2. Directed Graphs -
    - Minimum number of edges that can connect a vertex to all other vertices is represented by n-1. This excludes self loop.
    - If there are n vertices, then maximum possible number of edges = n(n-1)

Ways to represent Graphs:
-------------------------
1. Adjacency Matrix -
    - Row and column of the matrix represents the vertices.
    - Each cell contains either 0 or 1. If the edge exists between 2 vertices, then cell contains 1 otherwise 0.
    - Example: Matrix[row][column]:
        - if undirected graph then, Matrix[vertex1][vertex2] = Matrix[vertex2][vertex1] = 1 means there is an edge between vertex1 and vertex2.
        - if directed graph then, Matrix[vertex1][vertex2] = 1.
    - Convention of Matrix is to consider rows as source and column as destination.

2. Adjacency List -
    - It is a list of Linked Lists which contains a vertex as a head and all vertices connected to it.
    - The size of list is equal to the number of vertices.
    - If new vertex is added to the graph, it is appended to the list as well with its corresponding connected vertices.

        list = 0 --> 1 --> 2 --> None
               1 --> 3 --> None
               2 --> 3 --> None
               3 --> None
